# Hangman
A little hangman game made in Python using knowledge from my first programming module.
10 categories each game, 10 increasingly harder puzzles. Limited lives.
v1 is purely command line.
v2 is UI based with additional powerups and difficulty levels.
v3 is in progress. Six new game modes are being added. Five of which are seemingly working.
